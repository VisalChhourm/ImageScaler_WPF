# ImageScaler #

Easily scale one or multiple images based on their aspect ratio at the same time.

## Options ##
- Scale by `width`: Images new widths = `new size`. Images new heights = `new size` / aspect ratio
- Scale by `height`: Images new heights = `new size`. Images new widths = `new size` * aspect ratio
- Scale by `scale up`: Images widths and heights will be multiplied by `new size`
- Scale by `scale down`: Images widths and heights will be divided by `new size`
